# Huffman Image Compression

## 📌 Overview

This project implements image compression and decompression using Huffman coding. The program reads an image, compresses it using Huffman encoding, and then decompresses it to analyze the compression ratio and redundancy.

# ✨ Features

✔️ Read an image from the images/ directory.

✔️ Convert the image into a bit string.

✔️ Compress the bit string using Huffman coding and save it as a binary file.

✔️ Decompress the binary file back into an image.

✔️ Display the original and decompressed images.

✔️ Compute and display the compression ratio and redundancy.

# 🛠 Installation

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository

### 2️⃣ Install dependencies

# 🚀 Usage

### 1️⃣ Place the images to be compressed inside the images/ directory.
### 2️⃣ Run the main script:

### 3️⃣ Enter an image number when prompted.
### 4️⃣ The program will:

* 🖼 Display the original image.

* 📦 Compress and save the image.

* 🔄 Decompress and display the reconstructed image.

* 📊 Output the compression ratio and redundancy.

## 📋 Dependencies

* ✅ Python 3.x 
* ✅ matplotlib for image visualization



### This project is based on Huffman coding, a lossless data compression algorithm. Special thanks to the open-source community for supporting Python image processing tools.
